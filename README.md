# ownchannel
Apple TV Template to create your own live tv channel.

1) You need a Mac running the latest version of XCode & OSX (up to date)
2) You need a live tv or radio source (format: m3u8, pls)
3) An Apple TV 4th generation (latest one)
4) A USB-C cable to sideload your channel on your Apple TV.

Template is using by default the NASA TV channel, you just need to change the URL in the ViewController.swift to
your own.  Pretty easy.
